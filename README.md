My Chonker

An append-only context stack for lossless aggregation.

Instead of merging meaning, My Chonker stacks context.

It aggregates structured information without asserting truth, authority, interpretation, or canon.


---

Purpose

My Chonker exists to preserve context safely.

Nothing is overwritten.
Nothing is decided.
Nothing is collapsed.

Interpretation is deferred.


---

What This Is

My Chonker is context infrastructure.

It collects and stacks structured context so it can be interpreted later by humans or downstream systems.


---

What This Is Not

My Chonker is not memory.
My Chonker is not truth.
My Chonker is not canon.
My Chonker is not an agent.
My Chonker is not an authority.

It does not evaluate meaning.
It does not resolve conflicts.
It does not assign importance.

Core Principles

Append-only
Lossless
Reversible
Non-canonical
Human-authorized interpretation


---

Conceptual Structure (Plain Language)

My Chonker is composed of three core artifacts:

Paper
A single-source JSON capture. Immutable and traceable.

Archive
A folder containing multiple Papers. No merging. No prioritization.

Container
An append-only aggregation of Papers. Preserves all content verbatim.


---

Controls

ThreadLens
A filter defining what to extract, not what matters.

BiasMode
Controls strictness of selection only. Never alters source data.


---

Usage Pattern

Run an autorun instruction in a source.
Receive a Paper JSON.
Store Papers in an Archive.
Aggregate via a Container.
Interpret later.


---

Design Rule

Structure is allowed.
Meaning is deferred.
Authority stays human.

My Chonker stacks context.
You decide what it means.
